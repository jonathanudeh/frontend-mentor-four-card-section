## My-process

### Built-with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid and flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What-I-learned
I learnt alot about responsiveness. Recreating the desktop view was a real tough one, but once I got it done I quickly realised how easy it was. Well, that's the essense of projects, so I can learn and be better than my previous self.

### Continued-development
Like I always say, I will be using more of css grid layout as well as flexbox so as to get really familiarized with them both.
